!(SaturnV)[SaturnV.png]
In my Systems Engineering Laboratory, we were tasked with choosing an existing system to "design". My team chose the Saturn V, and I volunteered to be our team lead. In our Conceptual Design Review (CoDR), I was in charge of creating our program objectives and goals, a feasibility analysis, a trade matrix for both architecture options, a work breakdown structure, and technical performance measures (TPMs) and their prioritization. I gained various system engineering skills during this lab, such as understanding a top down approach and the concept of cradle to grave.
