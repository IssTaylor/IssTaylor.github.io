In my Systems Engineering Laboratory, we were tasked with choosing an existing system to "design". My team chose the Saturn V, and I volunteered to be our team lead. In our Conceptual Design Review (CoDR), I was in charge of creating: 
- our program objectives and goals
- feasibility analysis
- trade matrix for both architecture options
- a product work breakdown structure
- Technical Performance Measures (TPMs) and their prioritization
