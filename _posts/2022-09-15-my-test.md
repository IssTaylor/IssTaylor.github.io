During my time in NASA Student Launch, I strengthened my capabilities in analysis by conducting trade studies and troubleshooting using a MATLAB live script. This script helped my team and I find our rocket descent time, kinetic energy, velocity, parachute size, and drift at various winds. I also gained more experience with writing technical reports; we wrote and submitted a proposal, a Preliminary Design Review (PDR), a Critical Design Review (CDR), a Flight Readiness Review (FRR), and a Post Launch Assessment Review (PLAR). This project shaped me into a more effective communicator in collaborative group projects.
