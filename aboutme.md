Hello! My name is Ashley Perez, and I'm a current Lockheed Martin Systems Engineer on the launch systems integration team. I've participated in various small demonstation missions, from ICD verification to sitting on console during day of launch. I’m currently looking to transition to the Los Angeles area, where I can apply my expertise to new missions while continuing to grow.
