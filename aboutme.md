My name is Ashley Perez (she/her) and I am a recent graduate from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona with a bachelors in Aerospace Engineering. I've participated in various NASA programs that have taught me how to write effective project proposals, introduced me to the review process that NASA enforces, and sharpened my interpersonal skills when working in groups. I would like to one day contribute to something that is important and meaningful during my career, like further enhancing the technology that involves putting humans in space.
 
Some of my favorite hobbies include taking a swim, drawing, model rocketry, and reading a good book.

### My story

I graduated from James A. Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. This is where Jaime Escalante was able to teach Hispanic students AP Calculus for the first time in the 1980â€™s. Once I had heard about it, it made my interest in STEM into a passion. I was inspired by the dedication and trust this teacher had in his students. I poured all my curiosity and passion into my coursework and extracurriculars, and it helped me lead me to where I am now.
