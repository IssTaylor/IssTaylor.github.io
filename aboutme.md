title: About me
---

My name is Ashley Perez (she/her) and I am a recent graduate from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona with a bachelors in Aerospace Engineering. I've participated in various NASA programs that have taught me how to write effective project proposals, introduced me to the review process for proposals, and sharpened my interpersonal skills when working in groups. I would like to one day contribute to something that is important and meaningful during my career, like further enhancing the technology that involves putting humans in space.
 
Some of my favorite hobbies include taking a swim, drawing, model rocketry, and reading a good book.
