Hello! My name is Ashley Perez and I am a recent graduate from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona with a bachelors in Aerospace Engineering. I've participated in various NASA programs that have taught me how to write effective project proposals and technical papers such as Preliminary Design Reviews. I was also able to sharpened my interpersonal skills when working in groups. Iâ€™m currently looking for a full-time position where I can further develop my skills and also build my career while challenging myself.
