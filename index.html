Hello! My name is Ashley Perez and I am a recent graduate from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona with a bachelors in Aerospace Engineering. I've participated in various NASA programs that have taught me how to write effective project proposals, introduced me to the review process for proposals, and sharpened my interpersonal skills when working in groups. Iâ€™m currently looking for a full-time position where I can further develop my skills and also build my career while challenging myself. 
 
Some of my favorite hobbies include swimming, drawing, model rocketry, and reading a good book.
